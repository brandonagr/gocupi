Create Thick TSP
================
forked the code in order to draw thicker lines to get more contrast. For detailed descriptions see file createThickTSP
How to set start point and pinup see http://4um.gocupi.com/t/draw-tsp-with-different-line-thickness/61

gocupi
======

Polargraph (vertical plotter / drawing machine) written in Go. Inspired by [Polargraph](http://www.polargraph.co.uk/) and [drawbot](http://marginallyclever.com/blog/drawbot/) projects, designed with the help of the [Dallas Makerspace](http://dallasmakerspace.org/)

Gocupi is different from existing systems in that it uses a Raspberry Pi to do most of the processing instead of relying on a microcontroller to parse commands. This gives it the ability to render complex svg files and patterns that would not fit in memory on a microcontroller.

**A kit with all the hardware needed is now [available on kickstarter](http://kck.st/1rTDruZ)**

Check out the [project page](http://brandonagr.github.io/gocupi/) for a general description, there are also several [wiki pages](https://github.com/brandonagr/gocupi/wiki) with additional information.

Quickstart Guide
================

Install Go
-----------
The full install guide is on [golang.org](http://golang.org/doc/install). For the Raspberry Pi you can [download precompiled binaries](http://dave.cheney.net/unofficial-arm-tarballs) to avoid the lengthy process of building go from source.

For example, installing go to the default location with a precompiled binary on a raspberry pi just takes 3 commands:

    wget http://dave.cheney.net/paste/go.1.3.linux-arm~multiarch-armv6-1.tar.gz
    sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go.1.3.linux-arm~multiarch-armv6-1.tar.gz
    sudo echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin' >> ~/.profile

(You must set GOROOT also if you install go to someplace besides the default /usr/local/go)

Fix the serial communication (for Raspberry Pi)
----------------------------
Change the default serial communication by editing /boot/cmdline.txt and remove references to `/dev/ttyAMA0`

Disable the getty on that serial port in /etc/inittab by commenting out references to `/dev/ttyAMA0`

In order to reset the serial communication port we need to `sudo reboot`

Setup gopath folder
----------------------------
Setup the folder for your gopath and set some path variables

    mkdir ~/gopath
    sudo echo 'export GOPATH=$HOME/gopath' >> ~/.profile
    sudo echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/gopath/bin' >> ~/.profile

Install needed dependency
---------------------
Install mercurial
`sudo apt-get install mercurial`

Download and build gocupi
---------------------------
From your home directory
`go get github.com/brandonagr/gocupi`

Run gocupi
----------
`gocupi` The gocupi executable should now be in your $GOPATH\bin folder, you can run the command with no arguments to display the help and what command are available

`gocupi setup 1000 700 700` The setup command can be used to initialize the dimensions of the polargraph hardware, the setup is stored in the generated gocupi_config.xml file

`gocupi -toimage grid 100 10` The -toimage flag causes the system to draw to an output.png instead of trying to control the stepper motors over serial
